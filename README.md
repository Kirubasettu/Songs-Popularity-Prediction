# Songs-Popularity-Prediction
"Our song popularity prediction system employs a sophisticated ensemble of five distinct models, each carefully designed to capture and analyze various facets of musical data his diverse set of models encompasses a range of machine learning techniques, allowing us to harness the strengths of different approaches. From deep learning neural networks to classical statistical models, our ensemble leverages the power of variety to enhance the accuracy and robustness of our predictions. By combining the unique insights derived from each model, we aim to create a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the factors influencing song popularity. This multi-model approach ensures that our predictions are not only accurate but also resilient across a wide range of musical genres and styles, providing a cutting-edge solution for anticipating the success of diverse musical compositions."
## Steps:

## Data Collection:
- Gather data on the top 50 Spotify songs from 2019. Include features like danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms, and time_signature.
- Include the target variable, which is a measure of song popularity (e.g., number of streams or chart position).

## Data Preprocessing:
-  Handle missing data.
- Encode categorical variables if needed.
- Scale numerical features if necessary.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Selection:
- Choose five different machine learning models. Common choices include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Model Training:
- Train each model on the training set.
- Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, or R-squared for regression tasks. For classification tasks, consider accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Fine-tune the hyperparameters of each model to improve performance.

## Prediction:
- Use the trained models to predict the popularity of new songs.

## Model Comparison:
- Compare the performance of the five models and choose the one that performs best on your specific dataset.

## Deployment:
- Once you have a model with satisfactory performance, deploy it for making predictions on new data.

# Python Code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

## Assuming X contains your feature data and y contains the target variable (popularity)

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing
## Assuming X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test are your training and testing sets

## Step 3-5: Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation
models = {
    'Linear Regression': LinearRegression(),
    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeRegressor(),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestRegressor(),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingRegressor(),
    'Support Vector Machine': SVR()
}

for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
    print(f'{name} Mean Squared Error: {mse}')


## Step 6-8: Prediction, Model Comparison, Deployment
